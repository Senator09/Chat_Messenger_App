## Project Description
Chat Messenger is a simple application that enables clients(users) to connect and exchange text-massages through a server. I have also added a chat filter featureâ€”any text that goes through the server, gets screen and bad words like IU (University of Indiana) gets filtered. This project expands my understanding of network I/O, threads and complex data structures.
